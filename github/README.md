Github scripts
==============

This directory contains some nice scripts for Github.

### Files

✔ **getAllIssues.sh**
> Script to download all the issues from Github and put it in a single Json file.

✔ **issues.php**
> This script will use the output of `getAllIssues.sh` and parse the Json file to a CSV file. This CSV file can then be used for further (manual) processing.
