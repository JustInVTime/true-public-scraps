No warranties. No quality assurances. No tests. Just a collection of 
undocumented scraps.

Let's not create too many separate repositories, and just use this 
public-scraps repo to collect our miscellaneous scripts that are 
not confidential.

If you add scripts from other places that okay. Just make sure you 
comply with their licenses.
